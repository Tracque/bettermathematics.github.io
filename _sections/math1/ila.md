**Short Summary:**
An introduction to linear algebra, mainly in R^n but concluding with an introduction to abstract vector spaces.  
  
The principal topics are vectors, systems of linear equations, matrices, eigenvalues and eigenvectors and orthogonality. The important notions of linear independence, span and bases are introduced.  

**Useful Notes:**
- [Matrix Mindmap](resources/math1/ila/Matrices.pdf) from Gesina
- [Exam advice and revision sheet](resources/math1/ila/Revision-Sheet.pdf)
- [No bullshit concept maps](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/conceptmap.pdf) good for seeing the big picture in the course
- [Linear algebra explained in 4 pages](https://minireference.com/static/tutorials/linear_algebra_in_4_pages.pdf) good resource to give you general idea. Might be worthwhile to go through it before the start of the course.
