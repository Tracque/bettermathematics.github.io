**Short Summary:** 

Differential geometry is the study of geometry using methods of calculus and linear algebra. It has numerous applications in science and mathematics. This course is an introduction to this classical subject in the context of curves and surfaces in Euclidean space. 

There are two lectures a week and a workshop every two weeks. There are biweekly assignments and a closed-book exam in December.
