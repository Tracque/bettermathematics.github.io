**Short Summary:** 

*CORE COURSE for Honours Degrees involving Mathematics*. 

Main topics: Linear Algebra, Rings and Modules, Determinants and Eigenvalues, Inner Product Spaces, and Jordan Normal Form.

It showcases the power of abstraction and brings together several different topics from earlier courses as well as new ideas, in order to present a view on some of the more advanced algebra that is critical for later courses and also in application, as well as of interest in its own right. The course also includes computer algebra, to support and illustrate some of the content.
